# Automotive Setup

## Hardware Configuration ##

* Use SSD storage only for automotive computers.

## Windows Configuration ##

* Make sure that neither the screen or computer goes to sleep.
* Configure the power button to shut down the PC when pressed.
* Change the value of the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\ForegroundLockTimeout to 0. (Default is 200000.)
* After setting a password, set up a PIN. When booting without a screen, remember that you will need to press a key like Enter or Space to bring up the PIN entry screen.
* Defer Windows feature upgrades and quality updates as long as possible. (They are safe to install, but the update process can cause unexpected delays in car performance.)
* In the System Control Panel, under Advanced System Settings and Performance, set Visual Effects to "adjust for best performance".
* BitLocker all permanently-attached drives on the PC.
