# Email Support

## Currently Supported Providers

These are email settings the code has been tested to work with. Feel free to add other major providers if you've verified they work for both POP3 and SMTP.

### Gmail

_POP3 Host:_ pop.gmail.com _Port:_ 995

_SMTP Host:_ smtp.gmail.com _Port:_ 587

Note: Gmail users must enable "less secure login" in their Google account settings and enable POP3 in Gmail settings for this to work. Alternately, if you have two-factor authentication enabled, you can use an app-specific password instead to avoid the "less secure login" setting.

### Outlook.com

_POP3 Host:_ outlook.office365.com _Port:_ 995

_SMTP Host:_ smtp.office365.com _Port:_ 587

Note: Outlook.com users must enable POP3 in Outlook.com's full settings for this to work. Additionally, set it to permit POP3 to delete emails.
