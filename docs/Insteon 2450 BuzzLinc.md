# Insteon 2450 "BuzzLinc"

The BuzzLinc configuration of an Insteon 2450 I/O Linc will be supported by HAController, so I wanted to document the creation of it here.

> A jumper across GND and N/O on an IOLinc and a piezoelectric buzzer connected to 5V and COM, voila, an Inseton BuzzLinc.

> The (+) terminal of the piezoelectric buzzer should be at 5V and the (-) terminal at COM.
